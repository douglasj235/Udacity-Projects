<p>The World Wide Web is a collection of HTML documents.  HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.  The Web has been around since the 1990s and has 30 billion pages.  HTML represents a majority of the documents on the Web.  Other documents or files found on the web include Microsoft Word, PDF, plain text, images, videos and music

<b>Major Pieces</b>
<p>Components of the web include: HTTP, Servers, Internet and Browser.  For a detailed explanation of the

<b>HTML</b>
<p>Hyper Text Markup Language documents makes up most of the documents you see on the web.  HTML 
is made up of: text content (what you see), markup (what it looks like), reference to other documents 
(images, videos, etc.), and links to other pages.
</p>
<b>HTML Markup</b>
<p>Tag: an HTML tag is always contained within angled brackets.  Most tags have an opening tag and a
closing tag.  Some tags (called “void” tags) do not require a closing tag.
</p>
<p>Element: an HTML element refers to everything within a set of opening and closing tags.
</p>
<b>Computers are stupid</b>
<p>Programmers need to write code exactly the way a computer understands (write in correct syntax).
